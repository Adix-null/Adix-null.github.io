				Hi, I'm Adam, I go by Adix Null online. Currently I'm a second year CompSci student. My main passion is developing
				things, mostly software projects. Most of my work requires a lot of problem solving, which I like because my
				favorite approach is rational decision making. Since the usual info is on Linkedin, below is a list of projects I
				have worked on throughout the years.

				That's about it for the tech projects, at least for the ones I feel deserve mentioning. What else can I tell about
				myself, I like challenging puzzles, chess, Counter Strike and 3d modeling.
