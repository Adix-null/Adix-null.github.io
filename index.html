				Hi, I'm Adam - a second year CompSci student, I go by Adix Null online. My main passion is creating digital things,
				mostly software projects. My work requires a lot of problem solving, which I like because I enjoy tackling complex
				challenges with a rational mindset. Since the usual info is on Linkedin, below is a list of projects I have worked
				on throughout the years.
